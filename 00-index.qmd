## Introduction

This website contains a collection of material for introductory statistics 
courses with **R**. The aim is to provide insight in fundamental principles and 
a broad overview and enable students to select and understand particular books 
and online material to dig in deeper in the diverse and fascinating field of statistics.

## Status

The selection of topics reflects what I think is useful as door-opener into 
various fields, useful in ecology and aquatic sciences. The material is 
based on former PDF slides and other course material, constructive comments and 
suggestions for improvement are welcome.
