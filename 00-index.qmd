## Aim and status

This is an alpha version of slides for basic statistics courses.

The selection of topics is somewhat arbitrary and without question very basic. It reflects my experience what I think is useful as door-opener.

The aim is to provide a broad overview and enable students to select and understand particular books and online material  to dig in deeper in the diverse and fascinating field of statistics.

It is based on former PDF slides and other material. It is still in an early stage of development, constructive comments and suggestions for improvement are welcome.
