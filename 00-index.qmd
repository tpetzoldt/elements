## Introduction

This website contains a collection of material for introductory statistics 
courses with **R**. The aim is to provide insight in fundamental principles and 
a broad overview and enable students to select and understand particular books 
and online material to dig in deeper in the diverse and fascinating field of statistics.

## Status

This is a beta version of slides for basic statistics courses.
The selection of topics is somewhat arbitrary and without question very basic. It reflects my experience what I think is useful as door-opener.

It is based on former PDF slides and other material. It is still in an early 
stage of development, constructive comments and suggestions for improvement are welcome.
